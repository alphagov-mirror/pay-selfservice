# pay-selfservice
GOV.UK Pay Self Service admin tool (Node.js)

## Running locally with `pay local`

*This requires the [Pay CLI](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-infra/tree/master/cli), which is not publicly available at present*

### Prerequisites
You have [set up your local development environment](https://pay-team-manual.cloudapps.digital/development-processes/setup-local-dev-environment/)

### Steps to run locally
* Clone repo to your `$WORKSPACE` eg `cd $WORKSPACE && git clone git@github.com:alphagov/pay-selfservice.git && cd pay-selfservice`
* `npm install`
* `npm run compile`
* `pay local launch admin --local selfservice`
* Go to: http://localhost:9400

Assuming you're up and running with the [Pay CLI](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-infra/tree/master/cli) and have selfservice running locally you shouldn’t need to restart the app to see changes you make.

We use [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) which watches for changes to files and restarts the node process.

You can watch Nodemon do it’s thing if you run `docker logs -f selfservice`.

If you’re making changes to client-side JS or Sass files (anything within [`/browsered/`](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-selfservice/tree/BAU-update-README-to-explain-livereload/app/browsered) or [`/assets/`](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-selfservice/tree/BAU-update-README-to-explain-livereload/app/assets)) then running `npm run watch-live-reload` will watch for changes and recompile. Nodemon does not do anything here as that’s not necessary. If you install the [livereload browser plugin](http://livereload.com/extensions/) then it will refresh your page once the assets have been compiled to the `/public` folder.

### Steps to run locally - new method
The new method is faster and easier to run in debug mode.
* `./scripts/generate-dev-environment.sh local` - this will create a local `.env` file.
* Repeat the same steps above.
* Run the app with: `npm run start:dev`
* Go to: http://localhost:3000 -> Note the diff port number.

#### Run in debug mode
* You need to make sure the app runs locally first by using the instructions above.
* In VSCode, go to the `Debug` view - `CMD + shift + D`.
* Run the launch config `nodemon` by selecting it and pressing the green play button.
    * This will run the app in debug mode.
    * Add breakpoints.
    * The app will automatically restart when you make a code change.

## Running tests

#### To run mocha tests
```
npm run compile && npm test
```

#### To run cypress tests

Run in two separate terminals:
1. `npm run cypress:server`

    _This runs both the Cypress server and Mountebank which is the virtualisation server used for stubbing out external API calls._

2. Either:
- `npm run cypress:test` to run headless 
- `npm run cypress:test-headed` to run headed

See [About Cypress tests in selfservice](./test/cypress/cypress_testing.md) for more information about running and writing Cypress tests.
